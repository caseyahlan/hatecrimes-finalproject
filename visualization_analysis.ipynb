    "Noteably, the biases that motivated the least hate incidents are Anti-Native Hawaaiin, Anti-Mormon, Anti-Jehovah's Witness, Anti-Buddhist and Anti-Male. It's important to note that although Anti-Native Hawaaiin motivated hate crimes rank low via this chart, the original FBI data frame does not inclde hate crame data from Hawaii, as it is the one state which does not take part in the annual report. It would be interesting and potentially enlightening for future studies to consult data on Hawaii's hate crimes, for there is much left uncovered.\n"
